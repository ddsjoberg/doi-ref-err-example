Although this assumption underpins the application   of trial results to clinical practice, it has rarely been tested. By independently derived prognostic models,   the results of the European Carotid Surgery Trial and the UK-TIA Aspirin Trial were reanalysed to find out   whether relative treatment effect varied with absolute baseline risk of stroke. There was significant   heterogeneity of relative treatment effect in both trials, resulting in substantial variation in absolute   treatment effect with predicted baseline risk. Although, on average, the application of overall trial results   to all patients will do more good than harm, a knowledge of the association between relative treatment effect   and absolute baseline risk will increase the cost-effectiveness of healthcare interventions by identifying   those patients in whom treatment is ineffective and those patients who are most likely to benefit.}},
